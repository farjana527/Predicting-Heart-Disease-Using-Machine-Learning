Preventing heart diseases has become an essential priority in today's world. Data-driven systems for predicting heart diseases play a critical role in enhancing research and prevention efforts, ultimately ensuring healthier lives for people. Machine Learning has emerged as a powerful tool in this domain, offering accurate predictions that can significantly improve outcomes.
The project involved analysis of the heart disease patient dataset with proper data processing. Then, different models are trained and and predictions are made with different algorithms SVM and Logistic Regression. This is the jupyter notebook code.# Predicting-Heart-Disease-Using-Machine-Learning
I've used a variety of Machine Learning algorithms, implemented in Python, to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. This is a classification problem, with input features as a variety of parameters, and the target variable as a binary variable, predicting whether heart disease is present or not.
