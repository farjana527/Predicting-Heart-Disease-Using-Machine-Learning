Preventing heart disease has become an essential priority in today's world. Data-driven systems for predicting heart diseases play a critical role in enhancing research and prevention efforts, ultimately ensuring healthier lives for individuals. Machine Learning has emerged as a powerful tool in this domain, offering accurate predictions that can significantly improve outcomes.

I have utilized Machine Learning algorithms implemented in Python to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. This is a classification problem, where the input features represent various parameters, and the target variable is binary, predicting whether heart disease is present or not.

Machine Learning algorithms used:
1. Logistic Regression.
2. Support Vector Machine 

Accuracy achieved: 91% (Logistic Regression)
